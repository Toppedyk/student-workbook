What is a nested route?
Nested routes allow for more complex user interfaces with components nested inside each other

When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)
like in gregslist when we clicked cars page then to cardetails page.

yes, like when we passed the id to append the cars url and ran the findbyID function on load
