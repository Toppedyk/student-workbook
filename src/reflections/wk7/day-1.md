What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation, one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair. The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the "driver", the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the "navigator"

What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
increased code quality: "programming out loud" leads to clearer articulation of the complexities and hidden details in coding tasks, reducing the risk of error or going down blind alleys
better diffusion of knowledge among the team, in particular when a developer unfamiliar with a component is pairing with one who knows it much better
better transfer of skills, as junior developers pick up micro-techniques or broader skills from more experienced team members
improved resiliency of a pair to interruptions, compared to an individual developer: when one member of the pair must attend to an external prompt, the other can remains focused on the task and can assist in regaining focus afterwards


What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
miscommunications bewtween pair, chance of distraction, different skill levels
