What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?
to update parts of a page in response to certain events, with the data these provide.

What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?
subscribe: adds new observable events
unsubscribe: removes observable events
broadcast: executes all events with bound data

Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
REVIEW
This allows the controllers proxy and services can all talk to eachother and pass data to eachother.
