What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
REST is an architectural style, or design pattern, for APIs
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer

What does Stateless mean?
the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API, Each individual request contains all the information the server needs to perform the request and return a response, regardless of other requests made by the same API user

What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
An identifier for the resource you are interested in. This is the URL for the resource, also known as the endpoint. In fact, URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.
The operation you want the server to perform on that resource, in the form of an HTTP method, or verb. The common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
