What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?
A pyramid shape to the code and a lot of '})' following the code. The cause of callback hell is when people try to write JavaScript in a way where execution happens visually from top to bottom

What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
async means it takes some time to complete and callbacks are what the function uses to produce the reult later when it is complete. 

Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell
1. Keep your code shallow and clean, can be done with correct naming conventions, this makes it easier to read. 
2. modularize, keep them small by having multiple, this makes them easier to read and understand.
