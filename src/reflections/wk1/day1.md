What I learned in coding school is how to code.



*In your own words, why do we use Git?*

We use Git to track versions and changes when working on code. This is important to use because when multiple developers are working on the same project, this allows them to see what changes the others have made and gives access to restore a previous version. 

*What are the benefits of having multiple branches?*
The benefits of having multiple branches is to be able to have different code in each branch of the project to allow the developer to test different code. This is a benefit because the developer can try multiple ways to solve a problem and can even merge the branches further on. 

*What is the difference between Git and GitHub*
Git is the version control manager of the code to track and mange changes. Github is a service online that is used to store the git repositories.
