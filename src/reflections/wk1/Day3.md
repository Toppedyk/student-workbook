1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

Afternoon Challenge Link: https://github.com/Toppedyk/mock 

My favorite tip from this reading was the very first one about using weight and color of text to set a heirarchy instead of making the text bigger. This is a tip I am going to implement right away because i is something i've struggled with in my design. 

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas. 

a few resources i will use when looking for good design is, Dribble's color search for color selection, Font awesome is a good tool to retreive icons, the material design guidlines mentioned in the readings will all be resource i will use for design.


3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

It makes it more user friendly and easier to read for the use. this makes them more likely to use your website over another poorly designed one.
