Day 4 thursday March 18
Afternoon Challeng Link: 

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

the purpose of a wireframe is to provide a skeleton of the page structure, functionality, and intended behaviors of the web page the developer is building. It represent the initial concept before beginning.


2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful? 

low-fidelity, mid-fidelit, and high-fidelity. 
the low-fidelity is useful because it eliminates anything distracting and focuses on the layout, and user flow

mid-fidelity is useful because they are still simple, but more detail is added to specific elements and the features are more distinguished from another

High-fidelity is useful because they are pixel-specific layouts. this allows them to explore more complex concepts like menus and interactive maps. 

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Yes, I think they are. It makes the developer simplify the concept they are trying to acheive so they don't get lost or frustrated when building their project.
