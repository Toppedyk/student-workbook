What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
A psueudo class is used to define a special state of an element. such as when a mouse hovers over it. Some of the ones i think i'll use the most are hover, root, after, and before.


What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
specificity determines which rule to apply to an elemnt when there are 2 rules targetting the same element and property


What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
One problem would be that it would overrule some specificity of some elements and could result in confusion because it overrides it.
