What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
we are implementing scrum techniques for planning and strategizing. for our projects we are using: trello, figma, lucid charts, mongodb, vue, JS, scss, css, & HTML. 

What went well so far?
we have really been on the same page as a group and have been efficient in our processes

What would you do differently? Why?
I think we need to rotate partners a little more to make sure everyone understands every portion of the project and how it functions.
