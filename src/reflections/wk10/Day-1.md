What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
Value type - it holds a data value within its own memory space
Reference type - stores the address where the value is being stored
Pointer type - do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object


What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?bool
 byte
 char
 decimal
 double
 enum
 float
 int
 long
 sbyte
 short
 struct
 uint
 ulong
 ushort

 when passed to a method, it creates a seperate copy of variable in method.

In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
stored as another value and can change dynamically when the other changes.
