What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
Enums are strongly typed constants. They are essentially unique types that allow you to assign symbolic names to integral values, one example is with directions instead of 0,1,2,3


How can you modify an Enum?
set it to a number or alter it's type

How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
I have not yet, I like the example of using them as directions or the example of the volume.
