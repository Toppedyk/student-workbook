Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The elements tab. This help breaks it down line by line so you can visually see which line is affecting the screen output. you can also test new code in this tab.

using a debugger. this allows you to do through code step by step and see how the values of data changes throughout the code execution.
