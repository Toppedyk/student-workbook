What is Scope ?
where the variable is availiable to use. the whole document vs local to function.


What is Hoisting ?
a JS mechanism that variables and funtion declorations are moved to the top of their scope before code executes. so it can be declared as a var below where it's already used in the code. 

In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
You would use let when: preferred for variable decloration now. you would use this when writing a funtion or a block of code. 

You would use const when: you want a variable to not be able to be updated or changed. 

You would use var when: declaring a global variable that you want to redeclare later or want it initialized as undefined when hoisted.
