Questions: 
What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
The benefits of making a plan before starting are that you have a more clear idea of what you want your app to look like. it makes it easier readable and will help you avoid having to rewrite code. 

How do you find answers when you are stuck?
I usually try to write it out on paper first, then google, then a TA or teacher. 

From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
It's ok to fail, and it will take a lot of practice to be a good programmer. but the important thing is to keep trying and not just accept something that works, but work harder to make it better.
